TO DO
--------------------------------------


* Fix schematic display in Elliptic filters. It is also needed to code the HP transformation, actually Elliptic filters are LP
* Do some research and add to the filter designer direct coupled filter, specially the inductive coupled shunt resonators
* Do some reasearch and add a filter design tool with the image parameter method
* Add the power combiner stuff
* Add the narrowband matching techniques recently included in the Qucs 0.0.20
* Add the wideband tool... and do some research concerning RFT and analytic method
* General impedance synthesis using Brune/Darlington synthesis
* Zverev transformations
* Smith chart tool
* IP3/NF/Power balance tool
