# Data display panel

The data display panel contain all the widgets needed for displaying data, including the graph limit settings. It contains three types of widgets:
* Cartesian plot:
    - S-parameter magnitude and phase plot
    - Stability plot
    - Port impedance
    - VSWR
    - Group delay
* Smith chart
* Polar plot
